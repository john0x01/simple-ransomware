# simple-ransomware
**A very simple (15 lines) ransomware made in python**


The program will encrypt files (sha512 hash) in the folder which it was runned.

Usage:
  
    python3 ransom.py
  
    (or simply just double click it)
 
**I do not recommend you to run it on your desktop or in any important folder**

Don't use it to harm anyone
